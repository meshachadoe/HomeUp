# HomeUp
Aiding housing inequity in large urban centers. Connecting those who are willing to help with those who need it.

## Running/Developing
### Setting up the repository
Clone the repo and install the dependencies in the frontend and the backend.
```
git clone https://github.com/meshachadoe/HomeUp 
cd HomeUp/backend
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Running the project
Both frontend and backend must be running simultaneously!

While the backend is running, open up another terminal to run the frontend:
```
cd HomeUp/client
npm start
```
